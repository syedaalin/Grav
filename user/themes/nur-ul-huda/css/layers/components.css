  Components Layer (Refactored)
  
  All styles have been extracted to individual modular files in css/components/*.css
  and imported via css/modern-vanilla.css.
  
  This file is kept empty or with just this comment to maintain @layer components existence 
  if needed by the build system or other imports, but modern-vanilla.css now handles it.
